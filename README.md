# Todo Mern CRUD App

## Still to be completed:

### `Update`

-   Figure out how to connect `edit task` in UI with put request
-   Need to find a way to utilise `isEditing` via a seperate function, in order to render EditTaskForm, which generates the Put Request.
-   `editTodo` sends the PUT Request and so should only be in the EditTaskForm

### `Toggle Completed`

-   Get functionality working
-   Think so far, no connection between front and backend
-   Requires new PUT Request in task_controllers in backend, and in context in frontend
